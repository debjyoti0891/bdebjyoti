I"<p>My keen interest in hardware technologies, coupled with my background in computer science, has driven me to pursue research in the direction of design automation algorithms and tools for architectures, for a variety of technologies. Recently, I am learning about the state-of-the-art in Deep Neural Networks~(NN) and understanding the NN strutures (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">Alexnet</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">Resnet</a>, etc).</p>
