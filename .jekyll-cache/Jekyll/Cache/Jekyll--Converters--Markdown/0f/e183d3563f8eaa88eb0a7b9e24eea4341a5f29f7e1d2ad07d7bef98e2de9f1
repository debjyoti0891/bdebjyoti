I"Ÿ<p>My keen interest in hardware technologies, coupled with my background in computer science, has driven me to pursue research in the direction of design automation algorithms and tools for architectures, for a variety of technologies. Recently, I am learning about the state-of-the-art in Deep Neural Networks~(NN) and understanding the NN strutures (<a href="#alexnet">Alexnet</a>, <a href="#resnet">Resnet</a>, etc).</p>

<p>In parallel, I have started using <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> for implementation of DNNs. For the purpose of designing efficient NN accelerators, the first step is to find a way to extract an exact description of the NN graph. I found out the possiblity of finding the execution traces of the defined NNs using <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">Torchscript</a> and then parsing them into a directed graph. However, this is almost an hack! A better alternative was to look at the Open Neural Network Exchange (<a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a>) format for NNs.</p>
