I"°<p>My keen interest in hardware technologies, coupled with my background in computer science, has driven me to pursue research in the direction of design automation algorithms and tools for architectures, for a variety of technologies. Recently, I am learning more about the state-of-the-art in Deep Neural Networks~(NN) and understanding the NN strutures. 
In parallel, I have started using PyTorch for implementation of DNNs.</p>
