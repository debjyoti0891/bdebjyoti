I"n<p>My keen interest in hardware technologies, coupled with my background in computer science, has driven me to pursue research in the direction of design automation algorithms and tools for architectures, for a variety of technologies. My recent works deal with state-of-the-art design automation for in-memory computing and quantum computing.</p>

<p>In addition to my primary research interests, I actively pursue embedded systems design on Arduino and Raspberry Pi development platforms. I am also interested in participating in hackacthons and learning new technologies, such as machine learning, blockchain, etc.</p>
